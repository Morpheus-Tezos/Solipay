ðŸ“Œ Security checks currently in place :

## Re-Entrancy

- No possible re-entrancy because any of the functions use fallback.

- Sets of **require** and **modifier** are in place to limit the access to certain functionalities.


## Arithmetic Overflow and Underflow

Every operations are safely computed with the **safeMath library**

## Block Timestamp Manipulation

Block Timestamp could be manipulated. It is used in our contract to update X price which is evolving regarding the APY and actual timestamp.

For instance in ProxySimple we do not use directly the blockTimestamp as reference for **Guard check**. In the following examples the require method use the expected amount and added interests when the timelock is over :

```
/// @notice fetch the value of x, give actual value if argument equal to zero
/// @dev view function usefull for interest computation
/// @param date a epoch time to add at the current time to fetch x value in the future
///@return x the value for a given date
function updateXprice(uint date) public view returns(uint x){
  uint z = 1000000;
  x = z.add((((block.timestamp.add(date)).sub(xLaunch)).mul(z).div(31536000)).mul(apy).div(100));
}
```
In the deposit function we determine the amount and added interest when the lock time will be past.

```
uint y = updateXprice(timeLock);
uint lockedAmount =(depositToX.mul(y)).div(z);
user[msg.sender].DepositLocked.push(lockedAmount);
```
So when the user call a withdraw request we check with a require if the deposit amount multipied by actual X price is equal or superior to the amount calculated during deposit :

```
uint x = updateXprice(0);
uint z = 1000000;
uint xWithdraw = withdrawAmount.mul(z).div(x);
require(xWithdraw <= user[msg.sender].xTotalDeposit, "can not withdraw more than you deposited");
uint deposit0 = (user[msg.sender].xDeposit[0]).mul(x).div(z);
require(deposit0  >= user[msg.sender].DepositLocked[0], "the first deposit can not be unlocked now");
```
